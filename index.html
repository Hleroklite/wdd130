            <p>My name is Garret James. I am from Snohomish, Washington, though I was born in Bothel, Washington.
                I love writing, reading, art, comics, sports, music, and Anime.
                I did school a few years back and was an English major.
                I swapped from being an English major to majoring in computer programing and then switched to Economics. 
                I then worked for about 2 years before now coming back to school.
                I am now studying web development and working full time while I do so.
                I hope to be able to graduate in year 2027.
                I live at home with my family, but plan to move back to campus at BYUI by next year.
            </p>
